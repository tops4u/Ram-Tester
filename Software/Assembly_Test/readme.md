If you just built your RAM Tester, you may use this Software to check if there is any problem.

*Be sure to test without the Display inserted at the beginnging. It would disturb the Test*

1. Upload the Test File
2. The Tester will now perform some self tests. If you get a Blinking LED something is wrong.
3. Let it run until you see a short red flash followed by a steady green LED - this indicates all self tests have run successfully
4. You need a Jumper Wire for the next test. Put one End in Pin 20 (the most upper-righthand Pin) follow all Pins in the ZIF/DIP Port and touch them one by one. For all Pins the LED should briefly change color.
5. Once you checked all pins and they were all successfully registered, the LED will turn orange.
6. Now it is time to put the Display in, just tilt is so, that all Pins make contact. The Display is refreshed every 1-2 Seconds. If you can read "TEST" in the center, everything is clear to go, you may now burn the current Firmware.
