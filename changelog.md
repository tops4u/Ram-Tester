v1.1 (2024-10-10)
- Added Test for KM44C1000AZ-70 (Test Time < 10sec)
- Tested Automatic Size detection for 256kx4 vs 1Mx4 Chips.
- Improved RAS Only Refresh (ROR) Init Algorithm to be more compatible

v1.0 (2024-10-10)
- TC514256-80 working (Test Time around 2 sec)
- Only 256kx4 DRAM are currently working correctly (faster 1Mx4 i.e. 70ns Types fail)
- Empty RAM Slot fails with Error 2 Pattern 2. This could be nicer
