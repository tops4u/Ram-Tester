# Ram-Tester

Ram Tester for vintage CBM Computer RAM Chips (most RAM commonly used in C64 / C128 / A-500 & A-2000).

If you like this little project, you can make a small donation via the *SPONSOR* button in the top menu bar. To give you an idea, I have spent approximately:
- **$100** in materials, including various tests and failures.
- **60+ hours** to get the code working.

There is a short YouTube video demonstrating the tester in action. *(Note: the current version no longer requires an adapter for ZIP but includes a built-in ZIP socket):*

## Why Build a RAM Tester?

I decided to create a tester to diagnose some of the common DRAM chips used in CBM computers from 1980 to 1990.

## Special Features

- **Fast!** All tests complete within 10 seconds.
- **Complete!** Tests include retention checks as well as column/row crosstalk.
- **Simple!** Build it yourself for roughly $20â€“30, or get one directly from me. *(Sales thread on [AmiBay](https://www.amibay.com/threads/memory-tester.2450230/))*.
- **Safe!** A built-in fuse protects the tester, and a ground short check detects internal RAM shorts.
