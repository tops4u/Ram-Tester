# Ram-Tester

Ram Tester for vintage CBM Computer RAM Chips (most RAM commonly used in C64 / C128 / most Amiga, many Atari and Apple Computers of the time).

It is now available with or without Display.<br/>

There is a short YouTube video demonstrating the tester in action.

*(Note: this video shows a prototype, the current SMD Design can be seen above. Handling without Display remains identical):*

## Why Build a RAM Tester?

I decided to create a tester to diagnose some of the common DRAM chips used in CBM computers from 1980 to 1990.
Overview, which RAM types can be tested (Numbers at the end are the tested retention times):
- 4164 (64K x 1) - 2ms
- 41256 (256K x 1) - 4ms
- 4416 (16K x 4) - 4ms
- 4464 (64K x 4) - 4ms
- 44256 (256K x 4) - 4ms
- 44258 (256K x 4) Static Column - 4ms
- 514400 (1M x 4) - 16ms
- 514402 (1M x 4) Static Column - 16ms

## Special Features

- **Fast!** All tests complete within 10 seconds.
- **Complete!** Tests include retention checks as well as column/row crosstalk.
- **Simple!** Build it yourself for roughly $20â€“30, or get one directly from me. *(Sales thread on [AmiBay](https://www.amibay.com/threads/memory-tester.2450230/))*.
- **Safe!** A built-in fuse protects the tester, and a ground short check detects internal RAM shorts.

**Documentation:**  
The documentation has been moved to the [WIKI](https://github.com/tops4u/Ram-Tester/wiki) section of this project.

- **$100** in materials, including various tests and failures.
- **80+ hours** to get the code working.
