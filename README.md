# Ram-Tester
Ram Tester for vintage CBM Computer RAM Chips (most RAM ever used in C64 / C128 / A-500 & A-2000)

If you like this little project, you can make a small donation via the *SPONSOR* button in the top menu bar. To give you an idea, I have spent around:
- 100U$ in materials, for various tests etc.... (also some failures).
- mote than 60h to get the code working. 

There is a short YouTube Video that shows the Tester in action:<br/>

I decided to build a tester myself with the aim of being able to test some of the common DRAM chips of the CBM computers 1980-1990.
