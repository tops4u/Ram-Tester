Update to v3.0 of the THT PCB - This is experimental it has not yet been built or tested!
v3.0 fixes two minor errors and moves the display to the center of the board. 

v2.0 TH PCB which has a Display Connector and works the same as the SMD Version.

**IMPORTANT Note:** It may be a good idea not to solder the display directly but to use pinheader sockets in case you need to access the ICSP to install Firmware updates.
