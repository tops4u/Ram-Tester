Update to v3.0 of the THT PCB - **This is experimental; it has not yet been built or tested!**
v3.0 fixes two minor errors and moves the display to the center of the board. This allows you to solder the display and still have the ICSP accessible for updates.

Deviations from the SMD Version:
- This Version does not feature any ESD/EMI protection.
- It has a Micro-USB instead of a USB-C since USB-C 6-Pin THT are hard to come by. 

v2.0 TH PCB is an evolution of v1, which did not have a display connector. 

**IMPORTANT Note:** It may be a good idea not to solder the display directly to v2 THT but to use pinheader sockets in case you need to access the ICSP to install firmware updates.
